# -Electric-Vehicle-Population-Visualization-using-Tableau
Created an interactive dashboard to analyze electric vehicle (EV) population data using Tableau. The dashboard visualizes trends, growth patterns, and geographic distribution of EVs, providing valuable insights into the evolving market. With features like dynamic filters and detailed charts, it facilitates a deep dive into the dataset, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data visualization and analysis, offering a comprehensive tool for understanding EV adoption and market dynamics Created.
